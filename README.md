## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- **Connect to Vertex AI** using the Python SDK.
- **Load a pre-trained AI model** for image generation without building one from scratch.
- **Send text prompts** to the AI model and receive generated images.
- **Understand the basics of building AI applications** with generative models on **Google Cloud**.

## Features

- **Vertex AI Integration**: Easily connect to Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI platform.
- **Pre-trained Imagen Model**: Use Google's Imagen model for image generation from text.
- **Flexible Text-to-Image Functionality**: Generate images based on any text description.
- **Seamless Image Output**: Save generated images locally for further usage.
